# the-watcher

## Introduction
The Watcher is a small project to learn vuejs and a solution for a private problem.
I've been looking for a simple tool to track series and movies I've watched or want to watch for a few times.

The big goal is to develop a single-page web application that pulls and stores data from a NoSQL database.

Other goals would be:
- Saving the data without proper registration (I don't know exactly how to do this yet)
- More will follow

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### What is the data.json file?
The data.json is for testing and debugging.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
